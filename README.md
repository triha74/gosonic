# go-sonic

A modern, Docker-based CI/CD pipeline tool written in Go.

## Overview

go-sonic provides a unified way to build, test, package and deploy applications using Docker containers. It uses a simple YAML configuration file to define stages and their execution environments.

## Features

- üê≥ Docker-based execution environments
- üìù Simple YAML configuration
- üîÑ Multi-stage pipelines
- üîç Built-in audit logging
- üåê Support for matrix builds
- üì¶ Volume mounting for caching and artifacts
- üîí Secure environment variable handling
- üèÉ Parallel execution support

## Installation

### From Source

Requirements:
- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-sonic.git
cd go-sonic

# Build and install
./build.sh
```

The build script will:
1. Clean previous builds
2. Update dependencies
3. Vendor dependencies
4. Run tests
5. Build the binary
6. Install it to your $GOPATH/bin

### Using go install

```bash
go install github.com/triha74/go-sonic@latest
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a `.sonic.yml` file in your project root:

```yaml
version: "1"
project:
  name: "my-project"
  language: "go"
  root: "."
  audit:
    store: "file"        # "file" or "s3"
    path: ".logs"        # Directory for file store or S3 prefix
    s3bucket: ""         # S3 bucket name if using S3
stages:
  test:
    runner: "docker/library/golang:1.24.1-alpine"
    commands:
      - "go test ./..."
  build:
    runner: "docker/library/golang:1.24.1-alpine"
    commands:
      - "go build -o app"
```

2. Run a stage:

```bash
gosonic run test
```

## Configuration

### Project Structure

```yaml
version: "1"           # Configuration version
project:
  name: string        # Project name
  language: string    # Project language
  root: string       # Project root directory
  audit:
    store: string     # "file" or "s3"
    path: string      # Directory for file store or S3 prefix
    s3bucket: string  # S3 bucket name if using S3
stages:
  stage_name:        # Stage definition
    runner: string   # Docker image to use
    commands: []     # Commands to execute
    volumes: []      # Volume mounts
    environment: {}  # Environment variables
```

### Stages

Each stage can define:

- `runner`: Docker image to use (e.g., "golang:1.22")
- `commands`: List of commands to execute
- `volumes`: List of volume mounts
- `environment`: Map of environment variables
- `requires`: List of stages that must complete successfully before this stage can run
- `timeout`: Maximum execution time

Example with stage dependencies:

```yaml
stages:
  test:
    runner: "golang:1.22"
    commands:
      - "go test ./..."
  
  build:
    runner: "golang:1.22"
    requires: ["test"]  # Build only runs if tests pass
    commands:
      - "go build -o app"
  
  deploy:
    runner: "kubernetes"
    requires: ["build", "test"]  # Deploy requires both build and test to pass
    commands:
      - "kubectl apply -f k8s/"
```

When running a stage with dependencies:
- gosonic verifies if all required stages have completed successfully
- Required stages must be run before the dependent stage
- Dependencies are verified using the audit logs from previous runs

Example execution:
```bash
# This will fail because 'test' hasn't run yet
gosonic run build

# This will work - run test first, then build
gosonic run test  build

# This will fail because build hasn't run yet
gosonic run deploy

# This will work - run all stages in the correct order
gosonic run test build deploy
```

Note: gosonic does not automatically run required stages. You must explicitly run stages in the correct order.

### Volume Mounts

By default, go-sonic automatically mounts the current directory (`.`) to `/workspace` in the container. This can be overridden by explicitly defining a different workspace mount.

```yaml
volumes:
  - type: bind          # bind, cache, or tmp
    source: "./src"     # Host path
    target: "/app/src"  # Container path
    readonly: true      # Optional, mount as read-only
```

Example with minimal configuration:
```yaml
stages:
  test:
    runner: "golang:1.22"
    commands:
      - "go test ./..."    # Will run in /workspace
```

Example overriding the default:
```yaml
stages:
  test:
    runner: "golang:1.22"
    commands:
      - "go test ./..."
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: "."
        target: "/app"    # Use different workspace
```

## Command Line Interface

```
gosonic [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
   run      Run one or more stages in sequence
   help     Show help
   
GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --sonic-file value, -f value  Path to sonic configuration file (default: ".sonic.yml")
   --var value, -v value        Execution variables in key=value format (can be specified multiple times)
   --help, -h                    Show help
```

## Execution Variables

You can pass variables to be used during stage execution using the `--var` flag. These variables can be referenced in your configuration using `${variable}` syntax.

```bash
# Run deploy stage with specific region
gosonic run deploy --var region.name=us-east-1

# Multiple variables can be specified
gosonic run deploy --var region.name=us-east-1 --var env=prod
```

### Using Variables in Configuration

Variables can be used in:
- Environment variables
- Volume paths

Example:
```yaml
stages:
  deploy:
    runner: "kubernetes"
    commands:
      - "kubectl apply -f k8s/"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: "${HOME}/.kube/${region.name}/config"
        target: "/root/.kube/config"
        readonly: true
    environment:
      KUBECONFIG: "/root/.kube/config"
      REGION: "${region.name}"
      ENV: "${env}"
```

## Audit Logging

go-sonic automatically logs all stage executions to JSON files in the `logs` directory. Each log includes:

- Project and stage information
- Git revision
- Command executed
- Start time and duration
- Execution status and any errors
